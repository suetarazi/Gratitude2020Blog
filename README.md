# Gratitude2020Blog
2020's been a rough year for many, yet if you can find the silver lining, there have been many unexpected gifts as well. Share in the blog what you're grateful for in 2020! 



Gratitude2020Blog is my favorite project so far. Like Twitter, it’s something that is relevant to everyone in every age group and demographic. From a technical perspective, it also stretches my body of knowledge and forces me into spaces where new learning must occur and then be applied. This is a full-stack web and mobile responsive application that requires a database, CRUD operations and a front-end to display the blog posts. 

2020 has been a year like no other, with a global pandemic and its ripple effects throughout the global community and economies both domestic and international. Schools have been closed or are now doing online learning and people in almost every industry have embraced working virtually. Mask-wearing and frequenting restaurants for take-out or a socially-distanced dine-in meal have become the norm. Layer on top of that a political climate that has been intense at its calmest moments really makes 2020 a year like no other! 

Yet, if we pause and try and find the silver lining, there have been many unexpected gifts that 2020 has brought as well! That, in a nutshell, is the drive behind this web and mobile-responsive application. I am inviting others to see the positive in our situation and blog about it. My hope is that it would make us feel more grateful as a community and more connected to each other.


# Project Goals

## MVP Goals

This project required me to approach things in an organized manner. I created MVP (minimum viable product) goals and then a few stretch goals that I would roll out in a future version. The MVP application is web and mobile-responsive and allows a user to contribute to the blog. The MVP also shows all previous posts to the blog, along with the date, first name and last initial of the person who posted.

## Stretch Goals:

Stretch goals include re-doing the front-end in React.js, which would give the application a sleeker look and feel. Another stretch goal is to add a ‘Like’ button or the ability to add one of a few Emoji’s such as a smile, heart, thumbs up, etc. Finally, my last stretch goal is to allow someone to reply to an existing post.
